richard st john s 8 secrets of success

1
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes. And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago. And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager,
這是一個我給高中生的兩個小時的簡報, 但我在這縮短成三分鐘. 七年前, 我搭著飛機, 來 Ted 的路上, 坐我在旁邊的人是一個高中生,


2
and she came from a really poor family. And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question. She said, "What leads to success?" And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer.
他家非常窮. 他想要為了他的生活做出一些改變, 他問我一個簡單的問題, "如何才能成功?" 然後我感覺非常差, 因為我無法給他一個好的答案.


3
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED. And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people! So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed,
接著下飛機, 然後來到了 Ted, 我就在想, 我現在再一間那麼多人成功的房間, 為何不直接問他們如何才能成功,


4
and pass it on to kids? So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick.
然後告訴小孩們呢? 所以這七年來, 我在這裡訪問了 500 個人, 我問他們做什麼才能導致真正的成功和拿到Ted 的票.


5
And the first thing is passion. Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion." TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money.
第一件事, 就是熱情, Freeman Thomas 說, 我被我的熱情驅動, Ted 是為了愛而做, 而不是錢.


6
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do." And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway. Work! Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work.
Carol Coletta 說, 我想要說服別人照我說的做, 然而有興趣的是, 如果你為了熱愛這件事而做, 錢自然就會來, Rupert Murdoch 對我說, 這全部都很困難


7
Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun." Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes! (Laughter) TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard.
沒有一件事是簡單的, 但是我覺得很有趣, TEDsters 都做很有趣的工作. 然而他們工作認真


8
I figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics. (Laughter) Good! (Applause) Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something
我理解到, 他們不是工作迷, 是工作X. Alex Garden 說, 要成功, 就要專注


9
and get damn good at it." There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice. And it's focus. Norman Jewison said to me, "I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."
這沒有秘訣, 就是練習 練習 再練習. 然後專注. Norman Jewison 對我說, 我認為做任何事都要專注你現在再做的某件事上.


10
And push! David Gallo says, "Push yourself. Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push." You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt.
然後壓力! David Gallo 說 "推你自己一把, 不管是生理的或心理的", 你就會一直推推推, 你會推到


11
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts. I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it." Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers. (Laughter) (Applause) Frank Gehry said to me, "My mother pushed me."



12
(Laughter) Serve! Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor." A lot of kids want to be millionaires. The first thing I say is: "OK, well you can't serve yourself;



13
you've got to serve others something of value. Because that's the way people really get rich." Ideas! TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea:



14
founding the first micro-computer software company." I'd say it was a pretty good idea. And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it's just doing some very simple things.



15
And I give lots of evidence. Persist! Joe Kraus says, "Persistence is the number one reason for our success." You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap!



16
Which of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure." (Laughter) So, the answer to this question is simple:



17
Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED. (Laughter) Or failing that, do the eight things -- and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success. Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews!
